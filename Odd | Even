Question: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/odd-or-even3618/1

Code:

class Solution{
    static String oddEven(int N){
        // code here
        
        // The most optimised way to check this is by using bit manipulation
        // Each number is represented in the form of binary - and if a given number has last bit as 1 - then it is odd, otherwise even
        // to check the last bit, we just have to do its & with 1 - if it results in 0 then even, else odd
        
        N = N&1;
        
        if(N==0)
        {
            return "even";
        }
        else
        {
            return "odd";
        }
    }
}
