Question: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/

Solution:
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {  
        
        // Here we can use the formula we know for finding out the LSB that is set
        
        int count = 0;
        while(n!=0)
        {
            n = n & (n-1);
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
