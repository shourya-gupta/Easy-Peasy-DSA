Question: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/magic-number4431/1
Solution:

class Solution{
    static long nthMagicNo(int n){
        //complete the function here
        
        // So, we know one thing that is - when we & our number with 1 - we get last digit - so we can use it for purpose
        
        // also right shifting the binary of the number will help us to proceed one by one
        
        long ans = 0;
        int i = 1;
        
        while(n>0)
        {
            // we will check if the last digit is 1 then multiply it with appropriate power of 5, 
            // else, if it was 0 - it would eventually after multiplication give us 0. So, we can leave it
            
            if((int)(n&1) == 1)
            {
                ans = (ans + (long)Math.pow(5, i))%1000000007;
            }
            
            i++;
            
            // Now we will keep our n right - shifted everytime this loop runs
            n = n>>1; 
        }
        
        return ans%1000000007;
    }
}
